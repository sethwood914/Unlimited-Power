            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Unlimited Power LLC is owned and operated by Kristofer Lester, a licensed electrician with over 25 years of experience. I founded Unlimited Power to establish an electrical contracting service built on strong customer relationships, repeat business, and word-of-mouth referrals.</p>

            <p>Have you experienced frustration with contractors who fail to keep appointments or show up late? At Unlimited Power, we pride ourselves on providing timely service at a reasonable cost, with no hidden fees or unnecessary upselling.</p>

            <p>Do you have a complex or persistent electrical issue that others haven't been able to resolve? Our skilled team is dedicated to finding solutions where others cannot.</p>

            <p>We aim to deliver projects that you’ll be proud to share with your friends. If you don’t think of us first when recommending an electrician, we haven’t met our own high standards.</p>
